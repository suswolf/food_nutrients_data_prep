# Food Nutrients cleaning and processing for EDA
This is a preliminary step for analyzing food nutritional data. I wanted to know which foods were the most caloric and proteic in different cases and compare them, so I took a data set from Kaggle to get some insights. All the info can be found in the R Markdown.

Further analysis and visualizations were made using Tableau and are available in my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/views/FoodsNutritionalFacts/Historia1?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
